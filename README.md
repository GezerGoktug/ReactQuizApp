# ReactQuizApp
**<p>In this project, I created a quiz application with React. Help was taken from Redux in state management. In addition, the styled-components library was used to style the components. The project has features such as changing the answer when moving to previous questions, canceling the answer, calculating and rewarding points, showing errors and correct ones.</p>**
